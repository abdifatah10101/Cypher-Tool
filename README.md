# Enigma Light Cipher

This program is a simple text cipher that can encode or decode messages by shifting each character in a custom alphabet by one position. It uses two dictionaries—one for encryption and one for decryption—created automatically by offsetting the alphabet. The user enters a message and chooses whether to encode or decode it. The program then transforms the message by replacing each character with its shifted counterpart.

## How It Works

1. The program defines a string of characters (`keys`) containing the lowercase alphabet, a space, and an exclamation mark.
2. A second string (`values`) is generated by rotating the characters in `keys` one position to the right.
3. `dict_e` maps each character in `keys` to its shifted version in `values` (encrypt dictionary).
4. `dict_d` maps each character in `values` back to its original in `keys` (decrypt dictionary).
5. The user enters a message and chooses whether to encode (`e`) or decode.
6. The program loops through each character and replaces it using the correct dictionary.
7. The final transformed message is returned to the user.
